 <p>In machine learning, a intents.json file is crucial for training conversational AI models, particularly in chatbot development. It acts as a structured knowledge base that defines the different intents (or purposes) users might have when interacting with the model, along with corresponding examples of how users might express those intents. This file essentially teaches the model what to expect and how to respond to various user inputs</p>
